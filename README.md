# unit-1-project - Doggy Flashcards

## MVP
- Flashcards will have images and text on them
- User can 'flip' through flashcards
- User can access a front and a back of the flashcard

### 
- add event listeners to html
- connect to API
- create a card
- have api randomly generate dog breeds
- store information onto card
- have buttons to flip through cards

### roadblocks
- how can I create keyboard commands in JS?
- css hover/card flip animation
- have a card back instead of generating info outside of the image
- save cards
